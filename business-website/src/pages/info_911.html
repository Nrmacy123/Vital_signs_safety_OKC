                <p class="mt-4 text-lg max-w-3xl mx-auto text-center no-print">Knowledge and prevention are the cornerstones of effective home safety. While our focus remains on preventing emergencies, being prepared with expert information can make all the difference in a critical moment. This guide combines our paramedic experience with practical safety knowledge every parent should have.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3 text-gray-600">For infants (under 1), use back blows and chest thrusts. For children (over 1), perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver). Never perform a blind finger sweep.</p>

                            <h4 class="font-bold text-[#366E8A]">Paramedic's Note:</h4>
                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">The most dangerous choking hazards aren't just small toys; they're often food. Grapes and hot dogs should be cut lengthwise into quarters. A quiet child is a major red flag‚Äîif they can't cough, cry, or speak, they are in trouble. Act immediately.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3 text-gray-600">Immediately run cool (not cold) water over the burn for 10-20 minutes. Do not use ice, butter, or ointments. Cover loosely with a sterile, non-stick bandage.</p>
                        <div class="mt-4 bg-[#C1E1F4]/50 p-3 rounded-lg">
                            <h4 class="font-bold text-[#366E8A]">Paramedic's Note:</h4>
                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Most pediatric burns I've treated are scalds from hot liquids like coffee or soup. The burn continues to damage skin even after the source is removed. The cool water is the most critical step to stop the damage. Seek medical attention for any burn larger than a quarter, or any burn on the hands, feet, face, or genitals.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3 text-gray-600">If you suspect your child has ingested something toxic, call the Poison Control Hotline immediately: <span class="font-bold">1-800-222-1222</span>. Do not induce vomiting unless instructed to do so.</p>
                        <div class="mt-4 bg-[#C1E1F4]/50 p-3 rounded-lg">
                            <h4 class="font-bold text-[#366E8A]">Paramedic's Note:</h4>
                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Have the product container with you when you call. The most common poisonings I've seen are from everyday items: medications (especially grandparents'), cleaning supplies, and button batteries. A button battery is a true emergency‚Äîif swallowed, go to the ER immediately.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3 text-gray-600">For minor bumps, apply a cold pack for 20 minutes. Monitor the child closely. Seek immediate medical care for loss of consciousness, persistent vomiting, confusion, or a fall from a significant height (twice their body height).</p>
                        <div class="mt-4 bg-[#C1E1F4]/50 p-3 rounded-lg">
                            <h4 class="font-bold text-[#366E8A]">Paramedic's Note:</h4>
                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">It's not the size of the bump on the outside, but how the child acts afterward that matters most. A child who cries immediately, is easily consoled, and returns to normal activity is usually fine. A child who becomes unusually sleepy, irritable, or "just isn't acting right" needs to be seen by a doctor.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3 text-gray-600">For any water incident, get the child out of the water immediately. If they are not breathing, start CPR. Have someone call 911. Drowning is silent and can happen in seconds.</p>
                        <div class="mt-4 bg-[#C1E1F4]/50 p-3 rounded-lg">
                            <h4 class="font-bold text-[#366E8A]">Paramedic's Note:</h4>
                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">The most lethal risk for toddlers is drowning, and it's not just in pools. Bathtubs, buckets, and toilets are major hazards. Constant, within-arm's-reach supervision is the only layer of protection that is 100% effective. Any child who has been submerged should be evaluated by a doctor, even if they seem fine.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3 text-gray-600">The leading cause of fatal injury for infants. Ensure the crib is completely empty: no blankets, no bumpers, no pillows, no toys. Place baby on their back to sleep.</p>

                            <h4 class="font-bold text-[#366E8A]">Paramedic's Note:</h4>
                            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Infants lack the neck strength to move their head if their airway becomes blocked by a soft object. The "Bare is Best" rule for cribs is a critical life-saving measure. Also be aware of strangulation risks from window blind cords and baby monitor cords placed too close to the crib.</p>
